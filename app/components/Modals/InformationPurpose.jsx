          However, in general, tennis organizations or clubs may require more

          Tennis is a sport played between two players (singles) or between two
          teams of two players each (doubles), using rackets to hit a ball over
          a net and into the opponents court. The objective of the game is to
          hit the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to return it
          properly, thus scoring points.
          <br />
          Tennis can be played on various surfaces such as grass, clay, or hard
          courts, and each surface has its own unique characteristics and
          playing style. The game is popular all over the world and is played at
          both amateur and professional levels. It is also one of the four major
          Grand Slam tournaments, which includes the Australian Open, French
          Open, Wimbledon, and US Open.
          <br />
          Tennis requires a combination of physical and mental skills, including
          hand-eye coordination, agility, endurance, and strategic thinking.
          Players must also be able to quickly react to the movements and shots
          of their opponent. The game has a rich history and tradition, with
          many famous players having achieved great success and acclaim in the
          sport.
